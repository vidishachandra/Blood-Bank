# Blood-Bank

Emergencies occur every minute. For each patient requiring blood, it is an emergency where they could have major setbacks if it is not available. A blood donation may be even more valuable than you realize. A single donation can help one or more patients. Every year India requires 40 million units of 250cc blood, out of which only a meagre 500,000 units of blood are available. The system software we have created is a Blood Bank System which helps us in managing various blood bank operations effectively.  

The project consists of a central repository database containing various blood deposits which are Recipient safe. The system displays the amount of blood available for user and the details associated with it like i.e. procedure and Recipient safe policies. It also gives the user his own dashboard where he can look at other things available in the menu. The database includes details of the user like name, blood type, date of storage etc. which helps us in maintaining and monitoring the blood deposits.

This project allows the user to check whether the required blood deposits of a particular group are available in the blood bank or not, which is then viewed graphically using a pie chart for easy understanding of the blood donations. The system provides the computed data represented for blood type donated vs. requirement on line graphs. The system also displays information based on the age group of people who donate blood and this data is graphically available in the form of bar graphs for the user to select.

Moreover, the system has additional features such as sign up and login with other details. The user can view the blood group and the amount of blood available of each group once logged in. The system computes the amount of blood from which the certain blood type can be drawn from, including other blood groups and chooses the most conveniently available one. For example, if O+ blood type is more abundantly available than A+ for a patient of A+ blood type, O+ is provided as a first preference to the user.

During withdrawal, system will best draw conclusions from the graphs which will send the user details about the blood in the best way possible. The software is written in python with tkinter as the user interface. It is supported by a MySQL database to store the information of the donor, specifications of the blood and more details. This software is made for a social cause and to help society.
